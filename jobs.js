Hello,

I wanted to express my enthusiasm for this opportunity and my hopes of being considered. 
While my background may not be an advantage over other candidates, I believe my determination 
and eagerness to learn stand out, as demonstrated by my full-stack project, detailed in my CV. 
Your company caught my eye since I seek to enhance my skills and knowledge before taking on a 
permanent position, and working with technologies I am already familiar with - such as React and 
PostgreSQL - is something I look forward to continue doing. 
The hybrid work arrangement and potential for career growth make this opportunity especially 
appealing, and I am eager to contribute to your team while learning from experienced colleagues. 
I believe this traineeship would be an excellent stepping stone to furthering my technical abilities 
and establishing myself in the field.
Thank you for considering my application. I look forward to the opportunity to discuss how I can 
contribute to your team and assist with developing innovative software solutions.

Kind regards,
Stefan Plesoianu
